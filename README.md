# burger repo

This repo holds the files for another Coding Bootcamp homework project. This homework is mainly focused on using Node with Express routes, Handlebars server side rendering and a homebrew ORM on top of MySQL. This particular implementation uses jQuery and Ajax to hit the Express routes. Body-parser is used in the routes to pick up the data from the Ajax constructed request body.
